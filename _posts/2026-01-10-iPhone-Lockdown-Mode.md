📵 **Lockdown Mode** is Apple’s highest level of security for iPhone. It’s designed for people who may be **specifically targeted** by sophisticated spyware (like Pegasus), not just exposed to everyday scams or phishing. Think of it as a *digital safe room* for your phone.

## 👤 Who Should Care

Lockdown Mode is built for **high-risk roles**, including:

- Executives and board members 
- Journalists and media leaders  
- Government officials and diplomats  
- Lawyers handling sensitive cases  
- Human rights advocates  
- Anyone who has received an Apple **“possible targeted attack”** alert  

If your position, influence, or access to sensitive information makes you valuable to an attacker, this applies to you.

## 🎯 Real-World Threats It Protects Against

Lockdown Mode helps defend against **advanced, targeted attacks**, including:

- **Pegasus spyware** used to secretly monitor executives, politicians, and journalists and copy all data from their phone  
- **Zero-click iMessage attacks** where a phone is compromised without clicking anything  
- **Malicious web exploits** hidden in websites or ads  
- **Fake configuration profiles** used to remotely control devices  
- **Nation-state or mercenary spyware campaigns** aimed at individuals, not companies  

These are not mass scams, they are *surgical attacks* aimed at specific people.

## 🔐 Why You’d Turn It On

Lockdown Mode dramatically reduces what attackers can exploit by limiting risky features:

- Blocks most message attachments and preview content  
- Restricts complex web technologies often abused by spyware  
- Stops unknown FaceTime calls and Apple service invites  
- Prevents installation of device management profiles  

In short: **fewer doors for attackers to break through**.

## ⏰ When to Use It

Turn it on when:

- You believe you’re being targeted  
- You travel to or operate in high-risk regions  
- You’re handling sensitive negotiations, investigations, or intellectual property  
- You receive a threat notification from Apple  

It’s not meant for daily convenience — it’s for **elevated risk moments**.
