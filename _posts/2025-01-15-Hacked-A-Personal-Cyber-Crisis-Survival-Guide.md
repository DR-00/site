It starts suddenly. Your phone stops working. Your email logs you out. Your bank account shows transactions you didn't make. Your smart home locks you out, and your car won't start.\
You've been hacked. Not just a device, your life.

This is what a full-spectrum personal cyber attack looks like. It's rare, but when it happens, it's devastating. And in today's hyper-connected world, no one is immune, especially high-net-worth individuals, executives, and public figures.

Here's what you need to know, and do, immediately.

### Signs You're Under a Full-Scale Personal Cyber Attack

- Your phone is disabled or acting erratically
- Accounts (email, social media, banking) are locked or accessed without your input
- You receive password reset notifications you didn't request
- Your smart home devices misbehave or lock you out
- Your vehicle won't respond to your commands
- Friends or colleagues report strange messages from your accounts
- Bank or crypto accounts show unauthorized activity

### Immediate Action Steps

In a true crisis, time is your enemy. Every second matters. Follow this protocol:

#### 1\. **Go Offline Immediately**

Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data on all devices. Unplug your home router. If you have reason to believe your phone is compromised, power it down and remove the SIM.

#### 2\. **Stop Using Compromised Devices**

Do not attempt to log in to accounts or reset passwords on compromised phones or computers. This can tip off the attacker and further expose you.

#### 3\. **Get to a Clean, Safe Environment**

Use a secure backup device or trusted contact's device to begin recovery. Avoid using public Wi-Fi or unfamiliar networks.

#### 4\. **Lock Down Financial Accounts**

Contact your bank, credit card companies, and investment institutions. Freeze or suspend access immediately.

#### 5\. **Alert Key Contacts**

Notify your attorney, family, and trusted advisors. Let them know you may be impersonated and not to trust unusual messages or requests.

#### 6\. **Do Not Engage the Hacker**

Whether it's blackmail, demands, or threats, do not reply. Every communication gives them more data.

#### 7\. **Call in Professional Help**

This is where we come in.
