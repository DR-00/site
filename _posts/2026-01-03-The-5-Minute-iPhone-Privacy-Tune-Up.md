Improving your digital privacy shouldn't be a chore. This combined checklist merges expert recommendations from your documentation and the latest security guides to help you secure your iPhone in about 5 minutes.

The focus here is on being a "hard target", making it difficult for companies to track you and for strangers to access your data.

### 🎙️ Siri, Voice, & Search

Disabling these features ensures your private conversations and habits are not logged or analyzed by digital assistants.

<ol>
<li>Your voice is your business; disabling this prevents your phone from recording your words.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Siri &gt; Talk to Siri &gt; Off</blockquote>
</li>
<li>You should wipe your existing digital footprint so there is no lasting record of your past requests.<br>
<blockquote>Select "Delete Siri &amp; Dictation History"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>This stops your phone from constantly tracking your behavior just to "suggest" your next move.<br>
<blockquote>Shut off all Siri Suggestions</blockquote>
</li>
<li>To keep your information siloed, prevent Siri from "learning" from your specific apps.<br>
<blockquote>Click every app individually in Siri settings and disable "Learn from this App"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Search engines often build a profile of your interests; switching to a private option protects your curiosity.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Safari &gt; Search Engine &gt; Change to DuckDuckGo</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

### 📍 Location & Hardware Access

Apps often request access to your sensors without a logical reason; you should restrict this to prevent 24/7 tracking of your movements.

<ol start="6">
<li>Most apps have no business knowing your precise location; limiting this prevents them from building a map of your daily life.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services &gt; Set apps to "While Using" or "Never"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>For many apps, knowing your general city is enough; disabling "Precise Location" protects your exact home or work address.<br>
<blockquote>Within Location Services, click individual apps and toggle off "Precise Location"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Restricting the camera and microphone ensures apps aren't "watching" or "listening" without a functional need.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Camera (and Microphone) &gt; Disable all except video calling apps</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Your phone tracks places you visit frequently; clearing this prevents a history of your most private locations from existing.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services &gt; System Services &gt; Significant Locations &gt; Clear History and Turn Off</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

### 📡 Connectivity & Anti-Tracking

These settings prevent your phone from "shouting" its presence to every network or advertiser you pass.

<ol start="10">
<li>This blocks apps from following your activity across other companies' websites for advertising.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking &gt; Disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Prevent your device from automatically communicating with unknown, potentially malicious Wi-Fi networks in public.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Ask to Join Networks &gt; Set to "Ask"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Using an "Advertising ID" allows companies to link your behavior across the web; turning this off breaks that link.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising &gt; Disable "Personalized Ads"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Marketers use invisible "trackers" in emails to see when and where you open them; this setting blocks that tracking.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Mail &gt; Privacy Protection &gt; Enable "Protect Mail Activity"</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

### 🔒 Device Security & Data

Final steps to protect your info from "shoulder surfers" and stop corporate data collection.

<ol start="14">
<li>This prevents strangers from reading your private messages while your phone is sitting on a table.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Show Previews &gt; "When Unlocked"</blockquote>
</li>
<li>If your phone is stolen, this adds a layer of protection that prevents thieves from changing your Apple ID password.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode &gt; Stolen Device Protection &gt; Turn On</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Stop sharing your personal usage habits and device performance data with Apple.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Analytics &amp; Improvements &gt; Disable all sharing</blockquote>
</li>
<li>AirDrop can be used by strangers to send you unwanted files or see your device name.<br>
<blockquote>Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop &gt; "Contacts Only"</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

**Pro Tip:** If an app asks for permission and you aren't sure why, say **No**. If the app breaks, you can always go back and turn it on later. Starting from a position of "No" is the best way to stay secure.
