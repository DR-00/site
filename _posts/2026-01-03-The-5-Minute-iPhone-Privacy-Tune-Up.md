Improving your digital privacy shouldn't be a chore. This combined checklist merges expert recommendations from your documentation and the latest security guides to help you secure your iPhone in about 5 minutes.

### 🎙️ Siri, Voice, & Search

Disabling these features ensures your private conversations and habits are not logged or analyzed by digital assistants.

1. Your voice is your business; disabling this prevents your phone from recording your words.
> Settings > Siri > Talk to Siri > Off
2. You should wipe your existing digital footprint so there is no lasting record of your past requests.
>Select "Delete Siri & Dictation History"
3. This stops your phone from constantly tracking your behavior just to "suggest" your next move.
>Shut off all Siri Suggestions
4. To keep your information siloed, prevent Siri from "learning" from your specific apps.
>Click every app individually in Siri settings and disable "Learn from this App"
5. Search engines often build a profile of your interests; switching to a private option protects your curiosity.
>Settings > Apps > Safari > Search Engine > Change to DuckDuckGo

### 📍 Location & Hardware Access

Apps often request access to your sensors without a logical reason; you should restrict this to prevent 24/7 tracking of your movements.

6. Most apps have no business knowing your precise location; limiting this prevents them from building a map of your daily life.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Set apps to "While Using" or "Never"
7. For many apps, knowing your general city is enough; disabling "Precise Location" protects your exact home or work address.
>Within Location Services, click individual apps and toggle off "Precise Location"
8. Restricting the camera and microphone ensures apps aren't "watching" or "listening" without a functional need.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera (and Microphone) > Disable all except video calling apps
9. Your phone tracks places you visit frequently; clearing this prevents a history of your most private locations from existing.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Significant Locations > Clear History and Turn Off

### 📡 Connectivity & Anti-Tracking

These settings prevent your phone from "shouting" its presence to every network or advertiser you pass.

10. This blocks apps from following your activity across other companies' websites for advertising.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > Disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
11. Prevent your device from automatically communicating with unknown, potentially malicious Wi-Fi networks in public.
>Settings > Wi-Fi > Ask to Join Networks > Set to "Ask"
12. Using an "Advertising ID" allows companies to link your behavior across the web; turning this off breaks that link.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Disable "Personalized Ads"
13. Marketers use invisible "trackers" in emails to see when and where you open them; this setting blocks that tracking.
>Settings > Apps > Mail > Privacy Protection > Enable "Protect Mail Activity"

### 🔒 Device Security & Data

Final steps to protect your info from "shoulder surfers" and stop corporate data collection.

14. This prevents strangers from reading your private messages while your phone is sitting on a table.
>Settings > Notifications > Show Previews > "When Unlocked"
15. If your phone is stolen, this adds a layer of protection that prevents thieves from changing your Apple ID password.
>Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Stolen Device Protection > Turn On
16. Stop sharing your personal usage habits and device performance data with Apple.
>Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Disable all sharing
17. AirDrop can be used by strangers to send you unwanted files or see your device name.
>Settings > General > AirDrop > "Contacts Only"

**Pro Tip:** If an app asks for permission and you aren't sure why, say **No**. If the app breaks, you can always go back and turn it on later. Starting from a position of "No" is the best way to stay secure.
