Improving your privacy should not be a daunting task. This checklist helps you secure your iPhone in about 5 to 7 minutes, ensuring your location, search history, and voice remain your business alone. While these recommendations enhance your security, you should choose the settings that work best for your specific situation.

### 🎙️ Siri and Voice Privacy

Disabling these features ensures your private conversations and habits are not logged or stored by a digital assistant.

1. Your voice is your business; disabling this prevents your phone from recording your words.
> Go to Settings > Siri > Talk to **Siri** > Off.

2. You should wipe your existing digital **voice footprint** so there is no lasting record of your past requests.
> Select "Delete Siri & Dictation History".

3. This stops your phone from constantly tracking your behavior just to "suggest" your next move.
> Shut off all **Siri Suggestions**.

4. Allowing apps to "learn" from you lets them scrape your private data; you should disable this for every app to keep your data siloed.
> Click every app individually and disable **"Learn from this App"** and "Show in App".

### 📍 Location and Hardware Access

Apps often request access to your sensors without a logical reason; you should restrict this to prevent 24/7 tracking of your movements and environment.

1. Most apps have no business knowing your precise location at all times; limiting this prevents them from building a map of your life.
> In Settings > Privacy & Security > **Location Services**, set essential apps to "While Using" and all others to "Never".

2. This ensures apps aren't "watching" you or accessing your camera without a specific functional need.
> In Settings > Privacy & Security > **Camera**, disable access for all apps except those used for video calls or QR codes.

3. Restricting this prevents apps from eavesdropping on your private conversations or environment.
> In Settings > Privacy & Security > **Microphone**, only allow access for apps used for voice or video calling.

### 📡 Connectivity and Tracking

These settings prevent your phone from "shouting" its presence to every network or device you pass, which helps you become a "hard target" against public tracking.

1. Prevent your device from automatically communicating with every Wi-Fi network it encounters in public.
> Set "Ask to Join Networks" and "Auto-Join Hotspot" to "**Ask**".

2. Disabling this when not in use prevents your phone from constantly searching for and attempting to pair with unknown devices.
> Turn off **Bluetooth** when not connected to a known device and delete old connections like rental cars.

3. Block apps from following your activity across other companies' websites for advertising purposes.
> Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking and disable "Allow Apps to Request to **Track**".

### 🔒 General Security and Data

Final steps to protect your information from people nearby and to stop corporate data collection.

1. This prevents strangers or "shoulder surfers" from reading your private messages while your phone is locked.
> In Settings > Notifications, set **Show Previews** to "When Unlocked".

2. Stop sharing your personal usage habits and device data with Apple for their internal "improvements".
> Under Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, **disable all sharing**.

3. Prevent Apple from building an advertising profile based on your personal behavior.
> In the Apple Advertising section, disable "**Personalized Ads**".

4. Unused apps are a privacy leak; removing them ensures they aren't collecting data in the background.
> Take the opportunity to **delete** or offload any old or unused apps still on your phone.

> **Pro Tip:** Always ask "*why*" an app needs your data. If there isn't a logical explanation, it is your right to deny it.
