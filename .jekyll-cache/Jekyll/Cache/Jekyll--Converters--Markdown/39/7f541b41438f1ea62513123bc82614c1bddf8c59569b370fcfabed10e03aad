<p>It starts suddenly. Your phone stops working. Your email logs you out. Your bank account shows transactions you didnâ€™t make. Your smart home locks you out, and your car wonâ€™t start.<br />
Youâ€™ve been hacked. Not just a device, your life.</p>

<p>This is what a full-spectrum personal cyber attack looks like. Itâ€™s rare, but when it happens, itâ€™s devastating. And in todayâ€™s hyper-connected world, no one is immune, especially high-net-worth individuals, executives, and public figures.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what you need to know, and do, immediately.</p>

<p>In a true crisis, time is your enemy. Every second matters. Follow this protocol:</p>

<h4 id="1-go-offline-immediately">1. <strong>Go Offline Immediately</strong></h4>

<p>Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data on all devices. Unplug your home router. If you have reason to believe your phone is compromised, power it down and remove the SIM.</p>

<h4 id="2-stop-using-compromised-devices">2. <strong>Stop Using Compromised Devices</strong></h4>

<p>Do not attempt to log in to accounts or reset passwords on compromised phones or computers. This can tip off the attacker and further expose you.</p>

<h4 id="3-get-to-a-clean-safe-environment">3. <strong>Get to a Clean, Safe Environment</strong></h4>

<p>Use a secure backup device or trusted contactâ€™s device to begin recovery. Avoid using public Wi-Fi or unfamiliar networks.</p>

<h4 id="4-lock-down-financial-accounts">4. <strong>Lock Down Financial Accounts</strong></h4>

<p>Contact your bank, credit card companies, and investment institutions. Freeze or suspend access immediately.</p>

<h4 id="5-alert-key-contacts">5. <strong>Alert Key Contacts</strong></h4>

<p>Notify your attorney, family, and trusted advisors. Let them know you may be impersonated and not to trust unusual messages or requests.</p>

<h4 id="6-do-not-engage-the-hacker">6. <strong>Do Not Engage the Hacker</strong></h4>

<p>Whether itâ€™s blackmail, demands, or threats, do not reply. Every communication gives them more data.</p>

<h4 id="7-call-in-professional-help">7. <strong>Call in Professional Help</strong></h4>

<p>This is where we come in.</p>
